## Context

Modern users expect applications to support both light and dark color schemes for accessibility, comfort, and personal preference.
## Decision

The OneBookshelf application shall support both light and dark mode themes in the GUI.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Meets user expectations for theme support
- Improves accessibility and comfort for users in different environments
- Leverages well-tested, visually consistent themes from WebAwesome
- Reduces custom CSS/theming maintenance
- Aligns with modern PWA and web standards

### Negative
- Adds complexity to UI state management (theme switching, persistence)
- May require additional testing for theme-specific visual bugs
- Custom branding may be limited by the constraints of the default themes

## Alternatives Considered

- **Custom theme implementation**: Rejected due to increased maintenance, risk of inconsistency, and duplication of WebAwesome features.
- **Single theme (light or dark only)**: Rejected as it does not meet user expectations or accessibility standards.
